/**
 * An `EventsourcedActor` is an [[EventsourcedView]] that can also write new events to its event log.
 * New events are written with the asynchronous [[persist]] and [[persistN]] methods. They must only
 * be used within the `onCommand` command handler. After successful persistence, the `onEvent` handler
 * is automatically called with the persisted event(s). The `onEvent` handler is the place where actor
 * state may be updated. The `onCommand` handler should not update actor state but only read it e.g.
 * for command validation. `EventsourcedActor`s that want to persist new events within the `onEvent`
 * handler should additionally mixin the [[PersistOnEvent]] trait and use the methods
 * [[PersistOnEvent.persistOnEvent persistOnEvent]] and
 * [[PersistOnEvent.persistOnEventN persistOnEventN]].
