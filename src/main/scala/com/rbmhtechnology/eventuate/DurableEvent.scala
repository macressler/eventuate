/**
 * Provider API.

 * during event replication.
 *
 * @param payload Application-defined event.
 * @param emitterId Id of emitter ([[EventsourcedActor]] or [[EventsourcedProcessor]]).
 * @param emitterAggregateId Aggregate id of emitter ([[EventsourcedActor]] or [[EventsourcedProcessor]]). This is also
 *                           the default routing destination of this event. If defined, the event is routed to event-
 *                           sourced actors, views, writers and processors with a matching `aggregateId`. In any case,
 *                           the event is routed to event-sourced actors, views, writers and processors with an undefined
 *                           `aggregateId`.
 * @param customDestinationAggregateIds Aggregate ids of additional, custom routing destinations. If non-empty, the event is
 *                                      additionally routed to event-sourced actors, views, writers and processors with a
 *                                      matching `aggregateId`.
 * @param systemTimestamp Wall-clock timestamp, generated by the source of concurrent activity that is identified by `processId`.
 * @param vectorTimestamp Vector timestamp, generated by the source of concurrent activity that is identified by `processId`.
 * @param processId Id of the causality-tracking source of concurrent activity. By default, this is the id of the event log
 *                  that initially wrote the event. If the emitting [[EventsourcedActor]] or [[EventsourcedProcessor]] has
 *                  set `sharedClockEntry` to `false` then this is the id of that actor or processor (which is the `emitterId`).
 * @param localLogId Id of the local event log.
 * @param localSequenceNr Sequence number in the local event log.
 * @param deliveryId Set if an [[EventsourcedActor]] with a [[PersistOnEvent]] mixin emitted this event with `persistOnEvent`
 *                   or `persistOnEventN`.
